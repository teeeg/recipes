# Cashew Cheese Base

A simple base ferment for cashew cheese that can be seasoned with dried herbs or spices. Eat within two weeks. 

Ingredient | Quantitity | Notes 
---------: | :--------- | :----
Cashews | 400 g | Raw (swells to 575 g)
Rejuvelac | 80 ml |
Salt | 6 g | about 1 T

## Method 
1. Soak cashews for 24 hours and drain. You can soak the cashews less but keep in mind it will influence the texture of the cream. This recipe uses 24 hours as a consistent metric. A 24-hour soak swelled the cashews to 575 grams. 
2. Puree soaked cashews with rejuvelac in a high-powered blender until smooth. 
3. Ferment cashew puree at room temperature for at least 24 hours covered (allow room for expansion as cheese blooms). 
4. Combine with salt and dried herbs and store in the refridgerator or freeze.
