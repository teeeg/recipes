#Cashew Cheese Base

A simple base ferment for cashew cheese that can be seasoned with dried herbs or spices. Eat within two weeks. 

Ingredient | Quantitity | Notes 
---------: | :--------- | :----
Cashews | 400 g | Raw
Water | 100 g | 
Starter | 15 g | Leftover cashew cheese or soy yogurt to innocoluate batch
Salt | 1 T | 

## Method 
1. Soak cashews for 24 hours and drain. You can soak the cashews less but keep in mind it will influence the texture of the cream. This recipe uses 24 hours as a consistent metric. A 24-hour soak swelled the cashews to 575 grams. 
2. Puree soaked cashews with water and starter in a high-powered blender until smooth. 
3. Ferment cashew puree at room temperature for 8 hours covered (allow room for expansion as cheese blooms) 
4. Combine with salt to slow fermentation and store in the refridgerator.
