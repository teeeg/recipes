# Brittany Galette

Naturally vegan, gluten-free and incredible. Serve with some French cider for breakfast or dinner.

Ingredient | Quantitity | Notes 
---------: | :--------- | :----
Buckwheat groats | 200 g | about 1 heaped cup
Water | 230 ml | 
Salt | 10 g | coarse grey salt from Brittany!

1. Soak groats for 8 hours in water.
2. Drain groats, immerse in water once more and agitate to thoroughly rinse and then drain.
3. Combine soaked buckwheat groats with 230 ml of water and blend on high.
4. Let ferment for 24 hours before seasoning with salt.
5. To cook, spread enough of the batter in a hot frying pan to cover the base very thinly. When the base is dry, lower heat and rub the top with a piece of (vegan) butter and adorn with filling.
