#Chia Gel - Full Absorption

Presoaking the chia seeds prevents the seeds from robbing any moisture from other ingredients. I calculated the chia seed to water ratio by soaking the seeds overnight, removing excess water and weighing.  

Ingredient | Quantitity | Notes 
---------: | :--------- | :----
Chia seeds | 20 g | 
Water | 400 g | | 

## Method 
1. Whisk chia seeds into water.
2. Soak chilled at least 2 hours.
