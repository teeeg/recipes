#Chia Gel - Full Absorption

Presoaking the chia seeds prevents the seeds from robbing any moisture from other ingredients. I calculated the chia seed to water ratio by soaking the seeds overnight, removing excess water and weighing.  

Ingredient | Quantitity | Notes 
---------: | :--------- | :----
Chia seeds | 10 g | Approximately 10 Tbsp
Water | 200 g | | 

## Method 
1. Whisk chia seeds into water.
2. Soak for 10 minutes, stirring to facilitate absorption.
